in cancers", submitted

+ Step 4

Goal: compute empirical p-values

How to:

./calculatePValues.sh CANCER_TYPE

CANCER_TYPE has to refer to the directory create in step.01 in mutDir,
e.g., BRCA.
The script will invoke a c++ program to perform the randomizations
and return uncorrected p-values for each site, store in a file
named CANCER_TYPE_pvals.txt.
A p-value of -1 means that no mutation in a residue with structural
information was found. By default a value of 1 is assigned
to binding sites that do not have any mutations.

In case of multiple cancer types, you would have to run the script
for each cancer type.
