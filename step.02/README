+ Step 2

Goal:
Carry out a BLAST search against the BioLip database to extract
the reference sequences with a structural hit  

How to:
launch the "findMatchesPDB.sh" script
./findMatchesPDB.sh

The script will create a file named 'refSeqsAgainstBioLip.tab'
containing the results of the BLAST search.
Please note that the BLAST step might take a long time to finish.
